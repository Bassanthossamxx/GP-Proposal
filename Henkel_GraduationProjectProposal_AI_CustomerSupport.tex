\textit{Note: Project name is currently under review}

\section*{Executive Summary}
We are a team of final-year students from Benha National University developing an AI-powered customer support agent/service designed for Egyptian businesses. 

This project introduces an innovative approach to automated customer support with deep understanding of the Egyptian dialect, support for voice interactions, and real-time emotion detection. 

Our solution is fully customizable to fit each company’s unique workflows, with seamless integration into mobile apps, websites, and enterprise systems. We believe this solution has the potential to make a strong market impact by offering an affordable, scalable, and culturally-aware AI service. 

We specifically chose Henkel because of its strong commitment to AI, digital transformation, and innovation in consumer and industrial markets, making it the ideal environment to support and scale our project idea.
