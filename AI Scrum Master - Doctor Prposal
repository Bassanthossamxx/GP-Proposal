\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Dear Dr. Tamer,} \\
\end{flushleft}

We are a team of final-year students from the Faculty of Computer Science , BNU.  
We are writing to you with great admiration for your expertise in Software Engineering \&  artificial intelligence, 
and to respectfully invite you to be the official supervisor for our graduation project.  

After extensive research, we have defined our project \textbf{AI Scrum Master} (title under review).  
We believe your guidance would be invaluable in helping us navigate the technical, 
strategic, and product-related challenges of this endeavor.  

\section*{1. Project Summary}
Our project is an AI-powered Scrum Master that automates agile team management.  
Instead of traditional standups and manual reporting, the system continuously 
reads team activity (Slack messages, Jira tasks, GitHub commits), 
summarizes progress, detects blockers, and keeps documentation updated.  

The \textbf{AI Scrum Master} reduces meeting overhead, accelerates blocker resolution, 
and ensures real-time visibility into team performance.  

\section*{2. Introduction and Background (The Problem \& Our Solution)}

\textbf{The Problem:}  
Software teams spend significant time in repetitive meetings (standups, sprint planning, retrospectives),  
while managers must manually track blockers, dependencies, and progress.  
This creates inefficiency, delays, and risks of misalignment.  

\textbf{Our Proposed Solution:}  
We aim to build an AI Scrum Master that:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Reads Slack, Jira, and GitHub updates in real time.  
    \item Posts automatic daily standup summaries (done, in-progress, blocked).  
    \item Detects blockers early and suggests fixes or escalations.  
    \item Automates backlog grooming, sprint planning, and retrospectives.  
    \item Maintains self-updating documentation (reports, changelogs, sprint insights).  
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. Proposed Features \& Added Value}

Our AI Scrum Master will deliver:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Daily Standups:} AI auto-posts summaries in Slack.  
    \item \textbf{Sprint Planning:} Suggests fair workload distribution based on velocity and skills.  
    \item \textbf{Blocker Resolution Engine:} Detects issues and suggests solutions or escalates automatically.  
    \item \textbf{AI Retrospectives:} Provides process insights for continuous improvement.  
    \item \textbf{Cross-Team Coordination:} Tracks dependencies and integration blockers.  
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Graph:} Builds long-term memory of problems and solutions for faster unblock.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Added Value:}  
The system goes beyond an academic demo; our goal is to turn it into a product that can be 
showcased in competitions or potentially commercialized. We seek your guidance not only 
in technical aspects but also in shaping this project toward real-world adoption.  

\section*{4. Timeline and Deliverables (High-Level)}
We anticipate the project will span approximately \textbf{eight months}, with work divided into phases:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Phase 1:} Research and requirement gathering.  
    \item \textbf{Phase 2:} Prototype — design and present UI/UX screens for Slack interactions 
    and the project dashboard.  
    \item \textbf{Phase 3:} MVP version — implement core functionality with Slack integration 
    (inputs and outputs, including summaries and reports).  
    \item \textbf{Phase 4:} Full development — extend features to Jira and GitHub, 
    including screen designs and functional integrations, plus dashboard refinement.  
    \item \textbf{Phase 5:} Testing, validation, final documentation, and deployment.  
\end{itemize}


\section*{5. Resources}
We do not anticipate requiring significant financial resources. Our primary needs are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Your expert guidance and supervision.  
    \item Access to academic resources (journals, papers, datasets).  
    \item Mentorship on both engineering execution and positioning the project as a product.  
    \item Potential sponsorship or connections with industry to support our vision.  
\end{itemize}

\section*{6. Technical Specifications (Proposed Stack)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Backend:} Python + FastAPI, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis.  
    \item \textbf{AI/NLP:} Gemini 2.5 Pro API, HuggingFace Transformers, embeddings + vector DB for memory.  
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} React.js + Tailwind + Recharts, dashboard-focused.  
    \item \textbf{Integrations:} Slack, Jira and GitHub.  
    \item \textbf{DevOps:} Docker, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Railway/Render/AWS, monitoring (Sentry/Prometheus).  
    \item \textbf{Security:} OAuth2 + JWT with RBAC, input sanitization, signed webhooks, 
    encrypted storage, and secrets management.  
\end{itemize}

\section*{7. Terms of Supervision}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Meeting Frequency:} Bi-weekly or monthly sync-ups.  
    \item \textbf{Communication:} Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any preferred channel.  
    \item \textbf{Milestone Reviews:} At the end of each project phase.  
    \item \textbf{Approval:} Your formal approval of this project idea as our graduation project.  
\end{itemize}

\section*{8. Conclusion and Call to Action}
We are highly motivated to develop this project and are confident that under your 
supervision, we can deliver a high-quality, impactful solution that demonstrates 
both technical excellence and potential for real-world adoption.  

We would be honored to schedule a meeting at your convenience to discuss the 
project further, answer any questions, and receive your approval for this idea.
